This was supposed to be a game about chivalry riders, knights in shiny armours riding horses, killing dragons (and each other) in competition for a princesses hand.
It would be a strategy game. We would start as a lonely rider and slowly assemble our team in order to slake the evil dragon (or befriend it if you prefer dragons to princesses)

I haven't touched that project for queit some time now and I don't know if I will in the future.
